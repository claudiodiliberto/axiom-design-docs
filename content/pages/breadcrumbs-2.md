          Breadcrumbs use quaternary links \[Link] to allow the user to navigate
          to the parent pages. Parent page links have three interaction states:


          A) Default


          B) Hover


          C) Active

    title: Variations
    blocks:
      - text: >-
          Breadcrumbs with a large number of levels can auto-collapse using
          ellipses to reduce screen clutter. This is useful when space is tight
          or for responsive designs.\

          The ellipsis icon button \[Link] triggers a contextual menu containing the collapsed links. It has three interaction states:


          A) Default


          B) Hover


          C) Active

    title: Best practice
    blocks:
      - title: Links/Labels case
        text: Do not use uppercase in breadcrumbs labels.
        image: /assets/breadcrumbs_best_practice_1.png
      - title: Long links/labels
        text: Breadcrumbs with long links/labels will be truncated and rely on an
          ellipsis tooltip \[Link] to show the entire string.
        image: /assets/breadcrumbs_best_practice_2.png
      - title: Current page
        text: Do not use a link to represent the current page.
        image: /assets/breadcrumbs_best_practice_3.png
      - title: Long breadcrumbs
        text: Do not wrap breadcrumbs to multiple lines.
        image: /assets/breadcrumbs_best_practice_4.png
      - text: Instead use the ellipsis button icon \[Link].
        image: /assets/breadcrumbs_best_practice_5.png
      - title: "History vs hierarchy "
        text: Do not use breadcrumbs to show the user's history. Showing the actual
          steps the user took to get to the current page will not provide any
          benefit to the user and will create confusion.
        image: /assets/breadcrumbs_best_practice_6.png
      - text: Breadcrumbs should always show the hierarchical structure.
        image: /assets/breadcrumbs_best_practice_7.png
      - title: Donâ€™t be evil ðŸ˜ˆ
        text: Breadcrumbs originate from fairy tales, but that's a different kind of
          storytelling. Please donâ€™t do this.
